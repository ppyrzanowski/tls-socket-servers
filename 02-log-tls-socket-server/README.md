## 02-log-tls-socket-server

Logs properties of tls-socket to console. This was more of a playground for testing while studying
the [`node:tls`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html) docs and playing around. Please see
`03-log-tls-https-server` for a more elaborate and mature example.

See `01-echo-tls-socket-server` or `03-log-tls-https-server` for how to create the needed
server-certificate and private key for this prject.
